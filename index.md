# Learning on the use of markdown files.
## 1. Using headers.
- This section shows how to use `#` to make different heading above for example `#` is for H1 and `##` for H2

## 2. Displaing images
- ` [<image placeholder name>] (<image link>)` can be used to display images as shown below.

## 3. Adding code 
- Code can be added into a markdown tripple backticks
```
code line 1
code line 2
```

- You can specify the language you're using at the end of the opening tripple backticks as demonstrated below.
``` sh
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
#### displaying javascript code
``` javascript
const welcomeMessage = 'Hello Developer';
console.log(welcomeMessage);
```
## 4. Making a list
- lists can be created using ` - [x]  or - []`.
- When the square brackets have an `x` in between the box is checked signifying complete and the converse of this is true.
### Task I have achieved so far in this course.
- [x] Using headers.
- [x] Displaying  images in md files.
- [x] Displaying code with proper syntax highlighting.
- [ ] Making a task list.
